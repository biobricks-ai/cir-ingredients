# cir-ingredients

> The Cosmetic Ingredient Review (CIR) studies individual chemical compounds as they are used in cosmetic products.  CIR relies heavily on the International Nomenclature of Cosmetic Ingredients (INCI) when identifying the ingredients to be assessed.
>
> Ingredients of interest may be found on the label of a personal care product and searched using this database. Ingredients are often referred to on the label of a personal care product by the ingredient name as it appears in the International Nomenclature of Cosmetic Ingredients (INCI), known as the INCI Name. CIR reviews ingredients, not products. Furthermore, as a matter of practice, CIR does not usually review fragrances, colors, or flavorings.
